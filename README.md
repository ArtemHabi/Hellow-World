# Hellow-World
Hellow, two days ago I turned forty-one, 
a little sorry for myself that only by the age of forty 
had I discovered this amazing universe of programming and 
everything that revolves around it. 
This is a great happiness for me, 
so all my life I worked in the theater and cinema, 
which are now completely dependent on computers.  
I want to learn new knowledge not for work, 
or at someoneâ€™s direction, 
but for myself, so as to break into this new world I have not yet known.
